# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enable the existing poker tracking system to process new CSV ledger files and update the cloud database. The system has already been migrated from a local `data.json` file to a cloud database that serves the live webpage. Now the backend needs to be updated to process new CSV files and update the cloud database instead of the local JSON file, maintaining the same CSV processing workflow and functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a poker game administrator, I want to establish a connection to the cloud database from the backend processing system, so that I can update player data directly in the cloud instead of the local JSON file.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL establish a secure connection to the cloud database using proper credentials
2. WHEN database connection is established THEN the system SHALL verify connectivity and access permissions
3. WHEN connection parameters are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN database connection fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff before failing
5. IF network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL handle database connection errors gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a poker game administrator, I want to upload CSV ledger files through the frontend website UI and have them processed to update the cloud database, so that I can add new games without needing backend access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the frontend website THEN the system SHALL provide a CSV file upload interface
2. WHEN I select a CSV file THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and structure
3. WHEN a valid CSV file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL send the file data to a cloud function or API endpoint for processing
4. WHEN the CSV data is received by the processing service THEN it SHALL parse the game data and calculate net winnings
5. WHEN net winnings are calculated THEN the system SHALL update player statistics in the cloud database
6. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL return success/failure status to the frontend
7. IF a player nickname is not found in the database THEN the system SHALL report unknown players and not save the game
8. IF the CSV file format is invalid THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages to the user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a poker game administrator, I want to retrieve and display game results from the cloud database, so that I can view current player standings and statistics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN game results are requested THEN the system SHALL query player data from the cloud database
2. WHEN player data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL format and display results in the same format as the current system
3. WHEN displaying individual game results THEN the system SHALL show net winnings sorted by performance
4. WHEN displaying combined results THEN the system SHALL aggregate data across multiple games
5. WHEN displaying player statistics THEN the system SHALL show all historical metrics (net, biggest win/loss, games played, etc.)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a poker game administrator, I want the system to maintain data consistency between CSV processing and cloud storage, so that all game records are accurate and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing CSV files THEN the system SHALL use database transactions to ensure data consistency
2. WHEN updating player statistics THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent access to prevent data corruption
3. WHEN a database operation fails THEN the system SHALL rollback changes and report the error
4. WHEN processing multiple games THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity between games and players
5. IF network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL handle database connection errors gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a poker game administrator, I want to configure database connection settings, so that the system can connect to different cloud database environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL read database configuration from environment variables or config files
2. WHEN database credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL establish a secure connection to the cloud database
3. WHEN connection parameters are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN switching between environments THEN the system SHALL support different database configurations
5. IF database connection fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff before failing
